                    <h2>Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)</h2>
                    <p>Anthony Edward Stark is a fictional character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel
                        Cinematic
                        Universe (MCU) film franchise—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—commonly
                        known
                        by
                        his alter ego, Iron Man. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and
                        former
                        playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons
                        manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical
                        knowledge
                        into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would
                        threaten
                        peace around the world.</p>

                    <p>
                        In the late 2000s, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison
                        Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration,
                        the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the
                        Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to
                        keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.

                        Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to
                        power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop.
                        Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles
                        his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and
                        flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his
                        company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more
                        powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor

                            Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix and is attacked mid-race by Ivan Vanko, who
                            wields electrified whips powered by a miniature arc reactor. Stark dons his Mark V armor and
                            defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk
                            while
                            wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain
                            him.
                            The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.

                            Stark discovers a hidden message from his father, a diagram of the structure of a new
                            element,
                            which Stark synthesizes. At the Expo, Stark's rival Justin Hammer unveils Vanko's armored
                            drones
                            he had him make, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark
                            arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the
                            drones
                            and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his
                            drones.

                            Stark and the Avengers raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who
                            has
                            been experimenting on siblings Pietro and Wanda Maximoff using the scepter previously
                            wielded by
                            Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab and finds the scepter, along with
                            Chitauri ships from the Battle of New York and androids under construction. Wanda sneaks up
                            behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the death of
                            all
                            the Avengers except him. Stark awakens from the vision and grabs Loki's scepter.

                            Returning to Stark Tower, Stark and Bruce Banner discover an artificial intelligence within
                            the
                            scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense
                            program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks
                            the
                            Avengers at Stark Tower. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones,
                            kills
                            Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by
                            his
                            company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron, but Wanda subdues most of the team
                            with
                            personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage
                            until
                            Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.

                    <h3>Becoming Iron Man</h3>

                    <p>
                            In the late 2000s, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military
                            liaison
                            Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the
                            demonstration,
                            the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group,
                            the
                            Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest
                            to
                            keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.

                            Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor
                            to
                            power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the
                            workshop.
                            Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark
                            battles
                            his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger
                            and
                            flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that
                            his
                            company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker,
                            more
                            powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor

                            Stark learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a
                            coup
                            to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and
                            saves
                            the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest, revealing
                            that
                            Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to
                            replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to
                            being "Iron Man."

                            Six months later, Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful
                            means,
                            resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to
                            continue
                            his father's legacy, but discovers that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps
                            Stark
                            alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and
                            despondent
                            about his impending death, he appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries.
